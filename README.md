REVIEW
This projects works perfectly! It takes your input and reverses it perfectly. My favorite part was after you decide 
to replay the program, it says "LET'S PLAY AGAIN"
The program validates your final response correctly, making sure that the user can only type yes or no to restart or end
the program, and alerts the user that their response wasn't correct. Very well done!
